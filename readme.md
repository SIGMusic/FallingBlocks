# Cosmos

This is the main repo for the Cosmos processing project. We have 'desktop', 'android', and 'javascript' branches to handle those forks.

The only thing that is required at this time is our fork of PBox2D: https://github.com/rjmarsan/PBox2D which we will ideally make a JS version of.

This is a work-in-progress, and a step backwards since the presentation of it.  To see the original, check out the eoh branch.
